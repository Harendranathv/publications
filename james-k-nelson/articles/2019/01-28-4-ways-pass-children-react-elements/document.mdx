Did you know that React gives you no less than **four** different ways to specify the children for a new React Element?


## 1. Nesting JSX

To start with, there's the obvious way: nesting the elemen's between its start and end tags, like the blue div in this example:

```jsx
//---
maximizeLeftPanel: true
//--- index.js
ReactDOM.render(
  <div className="red">
    <div className="blue" />
  </div>,
  document.querySelector('#root')
)
//--- styles.css <-- red-blue-styles.css
//--- index.html <-- index-with-styles.html
```

The obvious approach is... kinda obvious. But it gives you a hint to approach number two. Given that JSX compiles to JavaScript, there must be a pure JavaScript way to do the same thing. And while there's a good chance that you already know the corresponding vanilla JavaScript, if you don't, you can find out by clicking on the *Compiled* button in the above editor.

And if you *do* click on the *Compiled* button, you'll see a couple calls to...


## 2. `createElement()`

JSX elements in a React project are transformed at build time into calls to `React.createElement()`. This function's first two arguments represent the elment's `type` and `props`, while any subsequent arguments represent the element's child nodes.

```js
React.createElement(
  type,
  props,

  // You can pass as many children as you need - or none at all.
  childNode1,
  childNode2,
)
```

For example, the two elements in the above JSX transpile to two separate calls to `React.createElement()`:

```js
React.createElement(
  "div",
  { className: "red" },
  React.createElement("div", { className: "blue" })
)
```

There are three important things to understand about `React.createElement()`:

1.  It returns a plain old JavaScript object that contains all of the information that you passed into it.
2.  It's first two arguments represent `type` and `props`, and any further arguments represent its `children`.
3.  You can pass as many children as you'd like... or none at all.

Simple, huh? But there's one curious thing about the object returned by `React.createElement()`. While the returned object has properties corresponding to the `type` and `props` arguments, it *doesn't* have a `children` property. Instead, the children are stored on `props.children`.

```js
//---
rightPanel: console
maximizeRightPanel: true
lineCount: 12
//--- index.js
console.log(
  React.createElement(
    "div",
    { className: "red" },
    "Hello, friend!"
  )
)
//--- index.html <-- index-without-styles.html
```

So what happens if you pass `React.createElement()` both a `children` **prop** along with the `children` **argument**? Let's find out!

```js
//---
rightPanel: console
maximizeRightPanel: true
lineCount: 12
//--- index.js
console.log(
  React.createElement(
    "div",
    {
      children: "Props win!",
      className: "red",
    },
    undefined
  )
)
//--- index.html <-- index-without-styles.html
```

As you can see in the above editor's console, **the `children` prop is ignored in favor of the value passed via argument** -- which happens to be `undefined`. But this raises a question: what would happen if you *didn't* pass a third argument?

This leads us to the third way to specify an element's `children`.


## 3. Pass a `children` prop to `createElement()`

When you pass a `children` prop to `createElement()`, *without* passing third (or subsequent) arguments, then that will become the element's children.

```jsx
//---
maximizeLeftPanel: true
//--- index.js
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement('div', {
    children: React.createElement('div', {className: "blue" }),
    className: "red",
  }),
  document.querySelector('#root')
)
//--- styles.css <-- red-blue-styles.css
//--- index.html <-- index-with-styles.html
```

This has an interesting corollary: you can also pass elements via props *other* than `children`. In fact, you can pass *multiple* elements to a component using multiple props. This pattern is sometimes called slots -- and you can learn more about it with [Dave Ceddia's guide to slots](https://daveceddia.com/pluggable-slots-in-react-components/).

Of course, you don't have to use raw JavaScript to pass a `children` prop -- which leads to the 4th and final way to specify an element's children...


## 4. Pass a `children` prop with JSX

Just as we started by transforming a JSX element into a call to `createElement()`, let's finish by rewriting the above with JSX:

```jsx
//---
maximizeLeftPanel: true
//--- index.js
ReactDOM.render(
  <div
    children={<div className="white" />}
    className="black"
  />,
  document.querySelector('#root')
)
//--- styles.css
.black {
  background-color: #000000;
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
}
.white {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  height: 50px;
  left: 25px;
  position: relative;
  top: 25px;
  width: 50px;
}
//--- index.html <-- index-with-styles.html
```


Ok, but... whhhy?
-----------------

Putting aside the question of whether you *can* pass children via `props` *<small>(you can)</small>*, let's ask a perhaps more important question: *should you?*

It goes without saying that *usually*, it's clearer to specify a JSX element's children the standard way. But with that said, there are a couple situations where the ability to specify `children` as a prop comes in handy.


### 1. Consuming Contexts

When working with React context, you'll run into a small problem when you need to consume values from multiple contexts: you need to nest context consumers within each other to access multiple values. And so just when you thought that [Promises and async/await](/courses/async-javascript/) had banished callback pyramids from the idyllic land of JavaScript *forever*, you end up with this:

```jsx
function InvoiceScreen(props) {
  return (
    <RouteContext.Consumer>
      {route =>
        <AuthContext.Consumer>
          {auth =>
            <DataContext.Consumer>
              {data =>
                <InvoiceScreenImpl
                  route={route}
                  auth={auth}
                  data={data}
                  {...props}
                />
              }
            </DataContext.Consumer>
          }
        </AuthContext.Consumer>
      }
    </NavRoute>
  )
}
```

The above code can be shortened by using the `children` prop, instead of nesting JSX elements:

```jsx
function InvoiceScreen(props) {
  return (
    <RouteContext.Consumer children={route =>
      <AuthContext.Consumer children={auth =>
        <DataContext.Consumer children={data =>
          <InvoiceScreenImpl
            route={route}
            auth={auth}
            data={data}
            {...props}
          />
        } />
      } />
    } />
  )
}
```

Of course, this still isn't perfect. For perfection, you'll need to wait for the new React [Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html), which will make consuming context a breeze.


### 2. Passing Through Props

<Doc.AsideTop>

Suppose that you have a component that just wraps another component -- possibly transforming the props in some way,  before passing them through to a child component.

In fact, you may have just seen such a component. To see what I mean, let me transform the previous `InvoiceScreen` example into plain JavaScript.

```jsx
function InvoiceScreen(props) {
  return (
    createElement(RouteContext.Consumer, { children: route =>
      createElement(AuthContext.Consumer, { children: auth =>
        createElement(DataContext.Consumer, { children: data =>
          createElement(InvoiceScreenImpl, {
            route,
            auth,
            data,
            ...props
          })
        })
      })
    })
  )
}
```

You'll notice that each calls to `createElement()` in the above example only uses *two* arguments, so any value for `props.children` will be passed through to `<InvoiceScreenImpl>`.

When you think about this, it makes a lot of sense. It would be confusing to have to specifically pass the `children` prop through. And luckily, you don't have to -- because React lets you specify children in an appropriate way for the situation!
