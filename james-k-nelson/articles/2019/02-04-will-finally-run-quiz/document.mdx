With the advent of `async`/`await`, I've recently found myself using a lot more `try`/`catch`/`finally` in my code. But honestly, I'm a little out of practice with `finally`. When I went to actually use it, I was a little unsure of its finer details. So I put together a few examples.


## When you `throw` a `catch`

Consider the case where you throw an exception *within* a `catch` block. There's nothing to catch your `throw` before it exits the function. Does `finally` run?

To find out, just uncomment the `example()` call at the bottom of the editor!

```js
//---
viewerURL: /index.js
//--- index.js
function example() {
  try {
    fail()
  }
  catch (e) {
    console.log("Will finally run?")
    throw e
  }
  finally {
    console.log("FINALLY RUNS!")
  }
  console.log("This shouldn't be called eh?")
}

// example()
```

<Doc.Spoiler>

The finally runs, even though the last log statement doesn't!

You can see that `finally` is a little special; it lets you run things between throwing an error and leaving the function, even if that error was thrown inside a `catch` block.

</Doc.Spoiler>


## Try without catch

Did you know that if you supply a `finally` block, you don't need to supply a `catch` block too? You probably did, but it was worth asking!

So next question: does that `finally` block get called even if nothing goes wrong in the `try` block? If you're not sure, uncomment the `example()` at the bottom of the editor to find out.

```js
//---
viewerURL: /index.js
//--- index.js
function example() {
  try {
    console.log("Hakuna matata")
  }
  finally {
    console.log("What a wonderful phrase!")
  }
}

// example()
```

<Doc.Spoiler>

Yep, `finally` is called even when nothing goes wrong. Of course, it also gets called when something *does* go wrong.

That's the idea behind `finally` -- it lets you handle both cases, as you can see in this example:

</Doc.Spoiler>

```js
//---
viewerURL: /index.js
//--- index.js
function example() {
  try {
    console.log("I shall try and fail");
    fail();
  }
  catch (e) {
    console.log("Then be caught");
  }
  finally {
    console.log("And finally something?");
  }
}

// example()
```


## Return and finally

So finally lets you clean up after yourself when exceptions occur. But what about when nothing goes wrong and you just `return` from the function like normal... in a `try` block?

Take a look at the below example. Is it possible that the `finally` block within `example()` can run *after* you've already hit a `return` statement? Uncomment the `example()` at the bottom of the editor to find out!

```js
//---
viewerURL: /index.js
//--- index.js
function example() {
  try {
    console.log("I'm picking up my ball and going home.")
    return
  }
  finally {
    console.log('Finally?')
  }
}

// example()
```


## The Rule

**The `finally` block on a `try`/`catch`/`finally` will *always* run** -- even if you bail early with an exception or a `return`.

This is what makes it so useful; it's the perfect place to put code that *needs* to run regardless of what happens, like cleanup code for error-prone IO. In fact, that's what inspired this article.


## I used `finally` for...

Frontend Armory is a statically rendered website; it's built with a tool called [Navi](https://frontarm.com/navi/), which lets you configure a `renderPageToString()` function that will be used to render each page.

In order to make sure each call to `renderPageToString()` is independent of the previous one, Navi uses `try`/`catch`/`finally` and some obscure node-fu to unload any modules that are loaded during the rendering process.

<Doc.Details aside>

You can take a look at the [full source](https://github.com/frontarm/navi/tree/master/packages/navi-scripts/lib) for Navi's static renderer on GitHub

</Doc.Details>

```js
let oldCacheKeys = new Set(Object.keys(require.cache))
try {
  html = await renderPageToString(options)
}
catch (e) {
  throw e
}
finally {
  process.env.NODE_ENV = nodeEnv

  for (let key of Object.keys(require.cache)) {
    if (!oldCacheKeys.has(key)) {
      delete require.cache[key]
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see from the above example, `try`/`catch`/`finally` also work great with JavaScript's new `async`/`await` syntax. So if this has reminded you that you need to brush up on `async`/`await`, now's the time to mosey on over to my [Mastering Asynchronous JavaScript](/courses/async-javascript/) course!

But that's it for today. Thanks so much for reading! If you have any questions or comments, shoot me a Tweet or DM at [@james_k_nelson](https://twitter.com/james_k_nelson). And until next time, happy coding :-)
